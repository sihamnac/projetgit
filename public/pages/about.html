<h2>
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large
projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion,
CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
